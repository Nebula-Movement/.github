## Problem Statement
When it comes to existing AI art platforms, there are quite a few issues:

- **Lack of Community Focus on Art and Prompt Creation**: Existing platforms tend to focus mainly on the end product - the AI-generated artwork - but often overlook the importance of the creative process, particularly the crafting of prompts which is crucial in the generation of quality AI Art.

- **Requirement for Detailed Prompts in Advanced AI Models**: Advanced AI models like Stable Diffusion Ultra and Midjourney demand intricately detailed prompts for high-quality outputs, a skill not all users possess due to varying levels of experience.

- **Absence of Incentive and Structured Improvement Methods**: Many platforms lack mechanisms that actively engage users in improving their AI art creation skills in a structured, rewarding, and enjoyable manner.

- **Limited Monetization Opportunities for Prompt Creators**: there's a noticeable lack of platforms that offer talented prompt creators the opportunity to monetize their skills. Despite the crucial role they play in the AI art creation process, these creators often have limited avenues to gain financial rewards for their expertise in crafting effective and intricate prompts.
